Wingfoil harness hook, designed to be printed in solid TPU and used with a cheap weightlifting belt.  For the leash, I either make my own or use this one.  The affordable setup makes it easy to add a leash and belt to each wing.
I used TPU as it's less likely to damage the board and traction pad than a hard plastic hook.  It's pretty much unbreakable and flexes slightly, which helps make it more secure since it takes up a small amount of slack.  While I prefer TPU, it will probably work in plastics too.  This part should be printed with 100% infill, especially if a more flexible filament like TPU is used.

The belt opening is about 2in tall and may be compatible with other belts.
